# Logging Example

This project shows a really simple WAR which uses the provided *slf4j* logging
framework.

Note that this project contains absolutely no target specific config files,
nor does it contain log configuration files.

Keep life easy.

This was tested on jboss-6.1.0.Final.

## Principle

It depends on the slf4j-api with scope *provided*

For testing purposes the slf4j-log4j and log4j was added in the scope *test*.

To use this just add a minimal log4j.xml in *src/test/resources* and Bob's your
uncle.

I purposely left out the test part to show nothing of the sort is *needed*.
